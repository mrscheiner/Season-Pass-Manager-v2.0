# Deploying Your App to GitHub Pages

## 1. Push your code to GitHub
Make sure your code is pushed to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.

## 2. Wait for GitHub Actions to build and deploy
Every time you push to `main`, your app will be built and deployed automatically.

## 3. Find your permanent web address
Your app will be available at:

```
https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/
```

For example, if your username is `jscheiner` and your repo is `Season-Pass-Manager-v2.0`, your address will be:

```
https://jscheiner.github.io/Season-Pass-Manager-v2.0/
```

## 4. Open on your phone
Just open that link in your phone’s browser. You can bookmark it or add it to your home screen.

## 5. Make edits
Edit your code on your Mac, push to GitHub, and your changes will appear at the same address in minutes.
